    <h2> <em> A hearty pizza for dinner!</em> </h2>

 

 <h4>Note:</h4> <em> Serves one person. Cook time is 30-40 minutes. </em>

 <br>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> <u> 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</u></li>
        <li> <u>1 teaspoon salt </u></li>
        <li> <u>1 cup water </u></li>
        <li> <u>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast        </u></li>
        <li> <u>1 pinch white sugar </u></li>
        <li> <u>¼ cup flour for dusting </u></li>
        <li> <u>2 cups pizza sauce </u></li>
        <li> <u>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese </u></li>
        <li> <u>20 leaves fresh basil </u></li>
        <li> <u>Olive oil </u></li>
        <li> <u> Sea salt to taste </u></li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Directions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
</ol>
